1. Income Statement:  
  An income statement is a financial statement that shows you the company's income and expenditures. It also shows whether a company is making profit or loss for a given period. The income statement, along with balance sheet and cash flow statement, helps you understand the financial health of your business.

2.	EPS:  
  Earnings per share (EPS) is calculated as a company's profit divided by the outstanding shares of its common stock. The resulting number serves as an indicator of a company's profitability. It is common for a company to report EPS that is adjusted for extraordinary items and potential share dilution.

3.	Efficient Frontier
  An efficient frontier is a set of investment portfolios that are expected to provide the highest returns at a given level of risk. A portfolio is said to be efficient if there is no other portfolio that offers higher returns for a lower or equal amount of risk. Where portfolios are located on the efficient frontier depends on the investor’s degree of risk tolerance.

4.	CAPM
  The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) describes the relationship between systematic risk and expected return for assets, particularly stocks. CAPM is widely used throughout finance for pricing risky securities and generating expected returns for assets given the risk of those assets and cost of capital.

5.	ROA
  Return on assets, or ROA, measures how much money a company earns by putting its assets to use. In other words, ROA is an indicator of how efficient or profitable a company is relative to its assets or the resources it owns or controls.
  
6.	ROE  
  Return on equity (ROE) is a measure of financial performance calculated by dividing net income by shareholders' equity. Because shareholders' equity is equal to a company's assets minus its debt, ROE is considered the return on net assets.

7.	Dividend Yield
  Dividend yield is the annual dividend payment shareholders receive from a particular stock shown as a percentage of the stock's price

8.	REITs
  REIT stands for Real Estate Investment Trust. REITs are well established in many countries worldwide and represent a widely recognized form of indirect property investment.

9.	Quick Ratio
  Quick ratio is a financial indicator of short-term liquidity or the ability to raise cash to pay bills due in the next 90 days. Also known as acid-test ratio, quick ratio measures the ability of a business to pay its short-term liabilities. Quick ratio is defined as: quick assets divided by current liabilities, and it is also known as the acid-test ratio and the quick liquidity ratio:

    Quick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities

10.	Working capital ratio  
   Like the quick ratio, this looks at how well a company can pay its existing debts. However, it considers all current assets rather than simply liquid assets, so you don’t need to subtract inventory from the equation. The working capital ratio looks like this when written as a formula:

    Current Assets / Current Liabilities
